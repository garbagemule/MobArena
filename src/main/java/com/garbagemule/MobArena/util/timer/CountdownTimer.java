/**
 * A simple implementation of a generic countdown timer, which has an initial
 * duration and a tick interval.
 * <p>
 * Every time the tick interval has passed, the {@code onTick()} method on the
 * underlying {@link TimerCallback} is called. If the tick interval is equal
 * to the timer duration, {@code onTick()} is never called.
 * <p>
 * When the timer "runs out" (when the duration has passed), the timer calls
 * the {@code onFinish()} method on the callback. In case that the duration
 * is not divisible by the tick interval, the final interval will be shorter
 * than the previous intervals to make sure the timer ends no later than it
 * should.
 * <p>
 * Stopping the timer prematurely via the {@link #stop()} method causes the
 * timer to immediately call the {@code onStop()} method on the callback,
 * and any subsequent ticks will be ignored. The timer supports stopping and
 * (re)starting in the same tick.
