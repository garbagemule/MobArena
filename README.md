MobArena [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/garbagemule/MobArena.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/garbagemule/MobArena)
========

MobArena is an arena-style minigame for Spigot-based Minecraft servers


## Getting Started

If you don't want to compile the plugin yourself, grab a release artifact from 
one of these two sites:

- [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/mobarena)
- [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34110/)

The wiki here on Github should have all the information you need to get 
started using the plugin.


## Getting Help

If you run into problems or need help with something, feel free to hop on the
MobArena Discord server to have a chat: [Instant Invite](https://discord.gg/5tnwQvC)

Remember, though, that this communication channel is _idle chat_, which
means you likely won't get a response immediately. It could take anything from
a couple of seconds to a day, but your message _will_ be seen.
