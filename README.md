# MobArena
MobArena is an arena-style minigame for Bukkit-based Minecraft servers.

## Getting Started
If you don't want to compile the plugin yourself, grab a release artifact from 
one of these two sites:

- [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/mobarena)
- [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34110/)

The wiki here on Github should have all the information you need to get 
started using the plugin.

## Getting Help
If you run into problems or need help with something, feel free to hop on IRC 
(#mobarena @ irc.esper.net) to have a chat. If you don't know what IRC is or 
don't have an IRC client, you can use a web-based one:

- [Webchat](https://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&channels=#mobarena)

Remember, though, that IRC is _idle chat_, which means you likely won't get a 
response immediately. It could take anything from a couple of seconds to a 
day, but your message _will_ be seen.

## Bugs and Suggestions
Found a bug or have a great idea for the plugin? Use the issue tracker here on 
Github to submit a bug report or feature request. Please have a look through 
the existing issues before you post a new one to avoid duplicates.
